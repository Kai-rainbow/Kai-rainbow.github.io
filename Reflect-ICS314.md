*E37: Reflect on Software Engineering*--


	Through this class, I can get more knowledge about programming. Especially, I wanted to learn more about application development and new programming languages. I think it is also a good experience to build webpages. A few more details about what I learned

  I. Coding standard
    While in this semester, I learned One of most important thing for programming is Coding Standard.  This is a kind of rule that is very important for programming, and learning it has good aspects such as efficiency in future projects and readability of my own code etc. However, I still feel that I have not fully understood and learned what was raised in class, so I would like to deepen my understanding more in future classes and through individual study.

  II. User interface Framework
    This learning experience is also very important for me. Because my dream is making something that makes this world a more comfortable place to live in. To my dream, I think the creation of a user interface is one of the most important tasks.

  III. AI learning
    This is the same topic that I already wrote about in my essay. If you're interested in the details, see my own essay. This topic is essential for those who will utilize soft engineering today and in the future. I was allowed to use AI in this class, used it, and experienced for myself what good and bad aspects it has, so I feel that this experience could be used in my future.
    
  Finally, this class contained very good experience and knowledge. The classes were a bit high-level and the assignments were frequent, although sometimesIgot stuck. However I believe that learning in this semester has brought me a little closer to my very abstract dream.
