*E28: Reflect on Coding Standards*

## What is coding standard 

The instruction of this assignment said about coding standards, ” minutiae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.” and it said it is the most important thing for improving software engineering. I agree with this opinion,, but I would like to express some different opinions.

## My opinion  coding standard 

I think it is very important to have the code standardized because Not only is it good to see easily, but it is also easy to understand when the project is handed over to someone else. However, while coding is partly a team work, I think it is also an individual work. It means, coding style should be what the individual is comfortable with.

## To solve opsite opinion

In my opinion, It could be a good idea to develop plug-ins that automatically convert original code to code standards.after coding as a compromise or some display which can show two types, original and standard.

## Intellij

ESlint with Intellij is satisfying in my opinion, It shows me when I miss the code standard with my mistake. However I sometimes think about being forced to use code standards while I am writing. For instance, If I missed the space between () and {}, it always shows as errors. I learned and used the style but It says it is an error. That is a little stressful. In addition, there is too much adherence to code standards and lack of coding freedom like it has an error if the code works. For example, when the code can work with let but it said the code should be used constm or when we use underscore it needs to put “var _ = require(“underscore”)”, but ESlint said var does not work, if the console shows correct.
It is a bad point that I feel while I use it. On the other hand, It is very useful to find mistakes and it  suggests how to fix them.
