*XC: Experience IDPM Effort Estimation and Tracking*

In the final project in ICS 314 in spring 2024, me and teammate were doing estimate and tracking time of coding our project. I'll show how affect these experiences with 4 Question.

	1.How did you make your effort estimates?
		I was guessing effort estimates based on my experiences with In-class WODs and assignment WODs. 
	2.Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?
		By estimating in advance, I was able to predict how much time I would need to spend before the submission deadline, allowing me to focus on other class assignments. Also, although this is in my personailty, I cannot give it my all unless the deadline is close, so I was able to identify the time when this was possible and was able to do so efficiently.
	3.Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?
		I do not know what benefit was made for tracking the actual effort, but I think I can refer to it in the future when I have similar projects.
	4.How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?
		I first thought about using a time tracking site, but was told that was not necessary. In fact, I placed a timer app on my PC next to IntelliJ and turned on the timer as soon as I started Coding, and stopped once when I took a break, etc. to measure. In addition, this is my environment and experiences, but I have had several problems with PCs crashing during coding. This made it difficult to time accurately and resulted in a small error.
