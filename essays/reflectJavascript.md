*E10: Reflect on Javascript 1*

## When I learned Javascript for a week.

It is my first time to learn Javascript, and I learned Java and C and C++ a little.
In my opinion, This language looks easier than the other languages that I learned,
even if I don't know how to display the result. However these languages are not quite different in the basics. So It was easy to understand while studying.


## WODs

For WODs, It was very hard for me to complete. I sometimes find the answer but I almost took a long time to finish it. But I think this is good for me to understand and practice coding.
