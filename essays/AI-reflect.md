*E37: Reflect on using AI*

### I. Introduction
Now that AI has already been around for several years, it has permeated many parts of our lives.
I was allowed to use AI in my ICS314 program, so I used it in a variety of situations, but there were some differences in its use in different places.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I will show my experience with AI in ICS314 in all situations in this class.
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:
  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
	Actually, we have not used AI much in Experience WODs.I didn't have much opportunity to use AI because I had to think on my own first for assignments, and if I didn't understand something, I would try to do it by watching a demonstration. In addition, one reason is also that I used it in the beginning but forgot to use it later.
  2. In-class Practice WODs
	In the In-class Practice WODs, I did not use AI as much because we did not have time limits and had time to think deeply because of the practice.
  3. In-class WODs
	And In-class WODs, I also didnâ€™t use AI because the problems were similar to the ones I had already done in experience WODs or the same as in In-class practice WODs, so It was up to me to come up with my idea.
  4. Essays
	I think this is probably where I used AI the most.I am not very good at writing beginning ideas so I asked AI what good ideas are. And I also could not judge whether my writing was generally correct or not, so I listened to it.
  5. Final project
	For the Final Project, I used AI to come up with design ideas and also to modify the code. However, most of the ideas were my own or those of my teammates, and I did not use AI much.
  6. Asking or answering a smart-question
	I had time to answer Smart questions in class, and I used AI for that as well. However, I was not able to fully understand the content because of the difficulty between what I heard and what the AI generated.

What I have listed above is my most of the entire experiences with AI in this ICS314.
	

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Using AI for learning was not bad for me. Because there are good things about AI, such as the fact that it can suggest ideas that I would not be able to come up with on my own, from a different point of view, like a teammate. However, I would be careful not to leave everything to it, as there is a possibility of plagiarism.

### IV. Practical Applications:
Recently, AI has been used in many places, for example, in answering customer questions and in games. In fact, there is a growing number of games in which AI is used to create and play something, and some of these games are very popular.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
I don't know if some of the code is not yet reflected in the AI when it is written, but sometimes it is written in a different language or completely wrong.To avoid using the wrong code, I think I have to understand the code I want to write and be able to recognize mistakes.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
As mentioned earlier, with the traditional education method, I can only reflect ideas from my own one-directional perspective, but with the introduction of AI, it is now possible to generate ideas that cannot be discovered by myself alone.

### VII. Future Considerations:
I believe that the use of AI in the future will be even more widespread than it is today, and that even people who have never studied programming will use it. In that situation, I believe that there may be some services that can be used for those who use AI.

### VIII. Conclusion:
In conclusion, While AI has good aspects, such as the ability for a person to come up with a wide variety of ideas, I think there are also bad aspects, such as overuse of AI that leads to obsessive use of AI and failure to recognize one's own potential and other abilities. I would like to coexist with AI, considering the social problems that will be caused by the further spread of AI in the future, while considering services using AI.
